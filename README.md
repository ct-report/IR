Contact Tracing - IR

**MASK** - centralized solution that relies on Bluetooth + GPS/Location data (if allowed by the user) + provided information by mobile operators.

It provides the users with a map, that shows the risk-score of surrounding areas (white = low-risk / yellow = moderate-risk / red = high-risk).

App usage is restricted only to devices using Iranian mobile / landline connections. There is Device+IMEI+SIM+IP/VPN detection in order to prevent foreign users from using the app & viewing the risk-score maps.
